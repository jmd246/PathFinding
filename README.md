A lightweight C++ project for constructing, visualizing, and experimenting with graphs and classical graph algorithms such as **Dijkstra**, **Prim‚Äôs**, **Kruskal‚Äôs**, **A\***, and graph coloring.  

This project provides a simple **ImGui-based UI** for graph creation and editing, with plans to add visualization for algorithms step-by-step.

## Features

- üñ±Ô∏è **Interactive UI** built with [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)  
  - Menu bar for graph actions  
  - Form-based input for creating custom graphs  
- üìä **Graph Representation**  
  - Stored as an adjacency list:  
    ```cpp
    std::map<std::string, std::set<edge>> m_adj_list;
    ```
  - `edge` includes `from`, `to`, and `weight`, with duplicate prevention  
- ‚úÖ **Input Validation**  
  - Prevents duplicate edges  
  - Ensures vertex/edge constraints are respected  
- üì¶ **Serialization** (WIP)  
  - Using [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) for saving & loading graphs  
- ‚ö° **Algorithms (Planned)**  
  - Dijkstra‚Äôs shortest path  
  - Prim‚Äôs minimum spanning tree  
  - Kruskal‚Äôs minimum spanning tree  
  - A* pathfinding  
  - Graph coloring

## Usage
  1.	Launch the application
      Build and run the project using your preferred C++ compiler and build system.
	2.	Create a graph
	    ‚Ä¢	Open the menu bar.
	    ‚Ä¢	Use the form to add vertices and edges (with weights).
	3.	Visualize & edit
	    ‚Ä¢	Interact with the graph nodes and edges in the ImGui interface.
	    ‚Ä¢	Modify or remove edges and vertices.
	4.	Run algorithms (future)
	    ‚Ä¢	Select algorithms like Dijkstra or A* from the menu to visualize step-by-step execution.
